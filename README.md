## ESoWC 2019 - Machine learning to better predict and understand drought.

Using [ECMWF/Copernicus open datasets](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) to evaluate machine learning techniques for the **prediction of droughts**.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
> The Summer of Weather Code(ESoWC) programme by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is a collabrative online programme to promote the development of weather-related open-source software.

This is our contribution to the ECMWF Summer of Weather Code programme where we will be developing a pipeline for rapid experimentation of:
- different machine learning algorithms
- different input datasets (feature selection)
- different measures of drought (meteorological, hydrological, agricultural)

Our goals are as follows:
- To build a robust, useful pipeline.
- Usefully predict drought.
- Understand the relationships between model inputs and outputs - *What is the model learning?*
- Make the pipeline and results accessible.

<!-- ## Proposed Approach -->

## Work in progress

We will be documenting the progress of our pipeline as go.
